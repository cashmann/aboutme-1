        <p>But I've got news for them, too. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough." We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush. For human history has often been a record of nations and tribes subjugating one another to serve their own interests.</p>
        <p>More work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Ill., who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour. And Ashley said that when she was nine years old, her mother got cancer. The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom.</p>
        <p>And God is still speaking. This is where we are right now. But this much is clear: governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful and secure.</p>
        <p>Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn't have the money to go to college. John Kerry believes in the Constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties, nor use faith as a wedge to divide us. I have already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy. "People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend's voice up into the rafters....And in that single note - hope! - I heard something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones.</p>
        <p>He was a good-looking kid, six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easy smile. E pluribus unum. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes. Their experience is the immigrant experience - as far as they're concerned, no one's handed them anything, they've built it from scratch. This is a difficult responsibility to embrace. I know there is debate about this issue. </p>
